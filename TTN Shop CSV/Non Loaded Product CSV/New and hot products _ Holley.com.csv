WHY GET A PACKAGE?

We understand the building a modified truck in stages is often preferred for various reasons. Not knowing how deep into the modification journey you may go or simply for financial reasons are common justifications for a measured approach. However, often when building in stages, parts are mixed and matched that were not designed to interact with one another which can lead to sub-par results and unhappiness with a vehicle you should be enjoying. By purchasing and installing popular curated packages of parts that were all designed to work with one another you bypass these common faults and receive a complete solution you can enjoy to the fullest from day one.

This comprehensive performance upgrade kit is tailored for 2025+ Ram 1500 pickups. The suspension upgrades feature ADS Racing Shocks Mesa 2.5 Series shocks, which are larger than stock, providing increased fluid capacity to prevent shock fade and deliver exceptional off-road durability combined with commuter comfort. The kit also includes a Outlaw Cat-Back Exhaust System, known for its hand-welded 409 stainless steel construction, offering an aggressive yet moderate tone. Additionally, this package is equipped with a Pulsar Cat6, a smartphone controlled app that allows you to add up to 78 RWHP (Hight Output models). Finally, Big Claw Performance Rotors are included, designed for improved braking performance and enhanced cooling to ensuring safety and reliability during high-performance driving.","Brand	ADS
