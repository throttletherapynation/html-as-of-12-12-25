THROTTLE THERAPY NATIONÂ„¢ Â€¢ THE MOVEMENT
BORN ON THE MOUNTAIN. BUILT BY THE PEOPLE WHO RIDE IT.
This Was Never Just About Machines.
RIDE. HEAL. BELONG.Â„¢ IS A PROMISE, NOT A SLOGAN.
Throttle Therapy Nationâ„¢ grew out of real seasons of grief, chaos, risk, and rebuilding â€” on and off the trail. Riders, families, widows, park owners, builders, and crews all helped shape a movement that refuses to pretend this is â€œjust riding.â€ Itâ€™s about giving people a place to breathe, heal, and belong while we teach them how to respect the terrain, each other, and the machines.

WHAT RIDE. HEAL. BELONG. MEANS
ÂŽŒ
RIDER EDUCATION CENTER THE HEART OF TTNÂ„¢
WHERE IT BEGAN
Built From Real Life, Not a Marketing Deck.

TTN started with a rider and a family walking through seasons that should have broken them â€” and a community that refused to let that be the end of the story. What began as â€œwe just need somewhere to breatheâ€ turned into â€œwe need a better way to ride, host, teach, and protect people who are showing up with more on their plates than anyone can see.â€
As the miles, mountains, and machines got bigger, so did the gaps: unclear maps, mixed expectations, unsafe builds, and people who were hurting long before they ever buckled a harness. Throttle Therapy Nationâ„¢ exists because riders, parks, builders, and families were willing to be honest about what wasnâ€™t working â€” and brave enough to build something better together.
THE CORE PROMISE
What Ride. Heal. Belong.â„¢ Actually Means.

RIDE
The Therapy Starts With the Throttle.
The machines, the mountains, the night rides, the mud â€” this is the doorway. We honor the part of you that needs noise, speed, challenge, and adventure. But we also refuse to pretend it doesnâ€™t come with risk. TTN is about teaching people to ride with skill, respect, and honesty about the variables no one can control.
HEAL
Thereâ€™s More Going On Than the Trail.
Behind every machine is a story: grief, burnout, trauma, transition, or a family trying to find their way back to each other. TTN doesnâ€™t promise to fix it all, but we create space for people to be real, to catch their breath, and to heal while they learn to move through the chaos more safely â€” together.
BELONG
Youâ€™re Not â€œJust a Riderâ€ Here.
Whether youâ€™re brand new, running point for a park, building cages in the shop, or trying to keep your family safe, youâ€™re part of why this Nation exists. TTN was built so nobody has to feel like an outsider, an afterthought, or â€œtoo muchâ€ to bring on the ride.
WHO WEÂ€™RE BUILDING WITH
A Nation of Riders, Families, Parks & Builders.

RIDERS & FAMILIES
The Ones in the Machines.
New riders, seasoned drivers, parents, kids, grandparents, widows, and future riders coming up behind us. TTN education, guided rides, and clarity exist so they donâ€™t have to learn every lesson the hardest way possible.

PARKS & DESTINATIONS
The Ones Carrying the Risk.
Park owners, trail teams, and destinations who are responsible for thousands of people, machines, and weather variables every season. TTN mapping, rankings, and clarity tools are being built with them, not just for them.

BRANDS & BUILDERS

More Than a Logo. A Connected Ecosystem.
From the first â€œI think I need thisâ€ ride to multi-park trips and big builds, TTN was designed as an ecosystem, not a one-off moment. Education, mapping, guided rides, trusted gear, parks, and apparel all work together so riders and families can move through seasons more safely and intentionally â€” without losing the joy that brought them here in the first place.

You Help Decide What This Nation Becomes Next.
TTN will never be â€œfinished.â€ It will keep growing as riders, families, parks, and partners speak up about what theyâ€™re seeing and what they need. If youâ€™ve walked through something you donâ€™t want the next person to have to navigate alone, youâ€™re part of why this exists.
